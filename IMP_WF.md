## 📝 Sprint 1: Critical Bug Fixes

**Sprint Goal**: Eliminate critical bugs that cause crashes or unexpected behavior

### User Stories

#### US-001: Fix Variable Scope Bug in Connection Disconnect
**Priority**: P0 - Critical  
**Story Points**: 1  
**Assignee**: [TBD]  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**:  
Fix critical bug where `transport` variable is undefined instead of `this.transport` in MCPConnection.disconnect() method, causing crashes when servers disconnect.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Variable scope bug fixed (line 595 in src/MCPConnection.js)
- [x] Added null check before calling terminateSession()
- [x] Unit test added to verify disconnect works correctly
- [x] Integration test verifies graceful disconnect scenarios
- [x] All existing tests pass

**Technical Notes**:
```javascript
// Location: src/MCPConnection.js:595
// BEFORE: await transport.terminateSession();
// AFTER: 
if (this.transport && this.transport.sessionId) {
  await this.transport.terminateSession();
}
```

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit test: `MCPConnection.test.js` - test disconnect scenarios
- Integration test: Verify graceful shutdown with multiple servers

**Definition of Done**:
- ✅ Code reviewed and approved
- ✅ Tests written and passing (100% coverage for change)
- ✅ Manual testing completed
- ✅ No new linting errors
- ✅ Documentation updated if needed

**Implementation Summary**:
- Fixed line 595: Changed `await transport.terminateSession()` to `await this.transport.terminateSession()`
- Added comprehensive tests for disconnect scenarios with sessionId
- Added tests for disconnect without sessionId
- Fixed logger mock to include `debug` method to prevent test failures
- Bug fix verified: Previously would crash when disconnect was called, now safely handles transport termination
