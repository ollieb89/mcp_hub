## Analysis Modes

### Sequential Analysis
```
Each expert provides insights in turn:
1. Christensen's disruption perspective
2. Porter's competitive analysis
3. Drucker's management view
4. [Continue with other experts]
5. Synthesis of all perspectives
```

### Debate Mode
```
Experts challenge each other's assumptions:
- Porter: "Competition is everything"
- Kim & Mauborgne: "Compete by not competing"
- Resolution: Find context where both apply
```

### Socratic Mode
```
Experts ask probing questions:
- Drucker: "Who is your customer?"
- Christensen: "What job are they hiring for?"
- Godin: "Would anyone miss this if it was gone?"
→ Guide strategic thinking development
```

## Application Examples

### New Product Strategy
```yaml
Christensen: "What non-consumption does this address?"
Porter: "What's your differentiation or cost advantage?"
Godin: "Is it remarkable enough to spread?"
Kim & Mauborgne: "What can you eliminate, reduce, raise, create?"
Collins: "Does this fit your hedgehog concept?"
Taleb: "What's the asymmetric upside?"
Meadows: "What system leverage points does this address?"
```

### Market Entry Strategy
```yaml
Porter: "Analyze the five forces in this industry"
Christensen: "Is this a sustaining or disruptive play?"
Kim & Mauborgne: "Can you create a blue ocean?"
Drucker: "Who values this and why?"

```
